Bubble sort 
 => Compares element and places last element at end
 => largest elemet will be compared with each element and places last in first loop
 => in sec loop will don't compare last element 
 => here elements are compared and swap
 
   ex.    7  8  3  1  2

    =>Here we do end-1 comparisons   
    => time complexity is Big O(n^2)
