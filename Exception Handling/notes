✅ What is Exception Handling?
An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program (e.g., divide by zero, file not found).

✳️ Types of Exceptions:
Checked Exception → Caught at compile time
e.g. IOException, SQLException

Unchecked Exception → Caught at runtime
e.g. ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
